### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grok. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: There are some parts of code that have to be improved
- **qa-needed**: QA software is an application that helps carrying out software quality assurance (SQA or software QA). Software QA is the process of ensure software quality. It includes various tasks like functional testing, source code quality and performance testing, just to name a few.
- **documentation-needed**: These features need to be described
- **bug-high-priority**: Bugs that have to be handled quickly
- **bug-low-priority**: Bugs that have no significant effect on app 
- **help-wanted**: There are some issues that require another people to be involved

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
